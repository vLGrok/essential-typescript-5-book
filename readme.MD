# Essential TypeScript 5 ‚Äì Learning Repository

This repository contains my work and notes as I follow along with **Adam Freeman's "Essential TypeScript 5"** book. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with TypeScript and apply best practices for development.

## Structure

The repository is organized by chapters and examples from the book:

```
/chapter-01
/chapter-02
/chapter-03
...
```

Each chapter directory will contain:
- Code examples explored in the chapter.
- My notes, comments, or modifications (if any).
- Solutions to exercises, if applicable.
